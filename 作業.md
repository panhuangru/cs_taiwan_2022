Operating System (OS)
**what is Operating System?**
-An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

# 作業系統的運作模式:Dual mode operation - 雙重模式
**user mode vs Kernel Mode**Kernel Mode 與 User Mode 的概念
The dual mode in the operating system consists of basically two modes of operation- User mode (also called non-privileged mode) and Kernel mode (also called supervisor mode, system mode, and privileged mode). When a user is running an application, the system is in user mode. However, when a user application requests to access a file (for reading and writing data), the system needs to switch from the user mode to the kernel mode through a system call since the files reside in the secondary memory, and the user can’t access them directly. After executing the system call, the system returns to the user mode.
 *User mode
  .When the computer system is run by user applications like creating a text document or using any application program, then the system is in user mode
  .When the user application requests for a service from the operating system or an interrupt occurs or system call, then there will be a transition from user to kernel mode to fulfill the requests.
  Note: To switch from kernel mode to user mode, the mode bit should be 1. 
 *Kernel mode
 .When the system boots, hardware starts in kernel mode and when the operating system is loaded, it starts user application in user mode
 . To provide protection to the hardware, we have privileged instructions which execute only in kernel mode
 . If the user attempts to run privileged instruction in user mode then it will treat instruction as illegal and traps to OS. Some of the privileged instructions are: 
-Handling Interrupts
-To switch from user mode to kernel mode.
-Input-Output management.
Note: To switch from user mode to kernel mode bit should be 0. 


# Privileged instruction（特權指令）
**whai is Privileged instruction**
-Privileged instructions are the instructions that are only executed in kernel mode.
-Some examples of privileged instructions include-
I/O instructions
Context switching
Clear memory
Set the timer of the CPU
Halt instructions
Interrupt management
Modify entries in the Device-status table
# kernal vs shell
**shell**
-It refers to a special user program or an environment that provides a user with an interface for using the services of the operating system
**kernal**
The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system
**different between shell and kernal**
1.Shell allows the users to communicate with the kernel||	Kernel controls all the tasks of the system.
2.	It is the interface between kernel and user||	It is the core of the operating system.
3.	It is a command line interpreter (CLI)||	Its a low level program interfacing with the hardware (CPU, RAM, disks) on top of which applications are running.
4.	Its types are – Bourne Shell, C shell, Korn Shell, etc||	Its types are – Monolithic Kernel, Micro kernel, Hybrid kernel, etc.
5.	It carries out commands on a group of files by specifying a pattern to match||	It performs memory management.
6.	Shell commands like ls, mkdir and many more can be used to request to complete the specific operation to the OS.	||It performs process management.
7.	It is the outer layer of OS.	|| It is the inner layer of OS.
8.	It interacts with user and interprets to machine understandable language.|| 	Kernel directly interacts with the hardware by accepting machine understandable language from the shell.
# Linux Operating System教學影片
-The Linux operating system (or Linux OS) is an open source
# linux kernal 英文版WIKI 中文版WIKI
The Linux kernel is a free and open-source,[12] monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel

# linux shell 英文版WIKI 中文版WIKI
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.
The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts
# shell: BASH(Bourne Again SHell) csh(The C shell)
# How to check what shell are you using
The following echo command or printf command should work:
echo "$SHELL"

OR
printf "My current shell - %s\n" "$SHELL"
# finger root
Finger command is a user information lookup command which gives details of all the users logged in.
# How to Change your Login Shell
The following is syntax for the chsh command:
chsh -s {shell-name} {user-name}

Where,

-s {shell-name} : Specify your login shell name. You can obtained list of avialble shell from the /etc/shells file.
User-name : It is optional, useful if you are a root user.
